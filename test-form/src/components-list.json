   {  "title" : "Historical Background",
      "type" : "section",
      "content" : "The Holyoke Canoe Club was founded on November 20th, 1885 by twelve local men with the intention of promoting canoeing on the Connecticut River. The first clubhouse was built in Holyoke, just upstream from the city’s dam.  The wooden structure was designed only to serve as a hold for a few canoes and to house a handful of lockers. As club membership rose, the facility became inadequate for the needs of its members, and a new clubhouse was built on the bank of the river near Kenilworth Castle. This new building was opened in 1895, and was more fitting for the club’s growing clientele, providing spaces for up to 60 canoes. The club began to expand its role into that of a private club for prominent locals. A parlor, meeting hall, and chart room were all included in the new design. In 1903, the club further upstream to Smith’s Ferry, near its present location. An even larger clubhouse was built, with a dining hall, meeting hall, boat repair room, lockers, and towers overlooking the river. Over time, the club’s rooms would be redesigned, and the club itself would be moved a few hundred feet on its plot of land, but it has roughly stayed in its present location for over a century. By the 1920s, tennis and volleyball courts were added to the grounds, and tournaments became commonplace. The courts became a crucial part of the Canoe Club, going through several major expansions and upgrades from their beginning through the late 1970s. With the dissolution of the Holyoke Yacht Club in 1921, the Canoe Club ushered in the end of an era of canoeing and established a power boat committee. More change came in 1950 and 1963 respectively, when a pool and pool house were added to the grounds. Originally an institution biased against Catholics and the lower classes, the Canoe Club expanded and lifted its exclusions of certain groups of people. As time passed, the club became less selective in its choice of members. The cap on the total number of members was gradually lifted, from a few hundred at the turn of the century, to the many hundreds who enjoy it today. ",
